# SimanyeNgogodo
I am a motivated junior developer with a strong foundation in web and systems development. I enjoy building practical applications, learning new technologies, and solving real-world problems through code.  I am currently seeking opportunities where I can grow, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to a dynamic team.
